	abstract = {The concepts of information and media literacy have been central components of digital literacy since the digitization of information began. However, the increasing influence of artificial intelligence on how individuals locate, evaluate, and create content has significant implications for what it means to be information and media literate. This paper begins by exploring the role artificial intelligence plays at the various stages of information retrieval and creation processes. Following this, the paper reviews existing digital literacy frameworks to ascertain their definitions of information and media literacy and the potential impact of artificial intelligence on them. We find that digital literacy frameworks have been slow to react to artificial intelligence and its repercussions, and we recommend a number of strategies for the future. These strategies center around a more agile, responsive, and participatory approach to digital literacy framework development and maintenance.},

By integrating ideas from crowdsourcing and learning theories focusing on learner-centered pedagogy, this work provides a review and classification of learnersourcing systems from the perspective of its three groups of stakeholders: (1) contributors, who are the learners who contribute new learning artifacts, (2) beneficiaries, who are the learners who learn from these artifacts, and (3) the instructional team who design and deploy learnersourcing tasks. The framework serves as a heuristic device for designing new learnersourcing systems and for considering the broader implications for learnersourcing in terms of workflow design, incentivizing contributors, quality-control, learning outcomes, delivering personalized learning experiences, ethical considerations, and its complementary relationship with AI in education.},

	abstract = {Background The use of crowdsourcing in a pedagogically supported form to partner with learners in developing novel content is emerging as a viable approach for engaging students in higher-order learning at scale. However, how students behave in this form of crowdsourcing, referred to as learnersourcing, is still insufficiently explored. Objectives To contribute to filling this gap, this study explores how students engage with learnersourcing tasks across a range of course and assessment designs. Methods We conducted an exploratory study on trace data of 1279 students across three courses, originating from the use of a learnersourcing environment under different assessment designs. We employed a new methodology from the learning analytics (LA) field that aims to represent students' behaviour through two theoretically-derived latent constructs: learning tactics and the learning strategies built upon them. Results The study's results demonstrate students use different tactics and strategies, highlight the association of learnersourcing contexts with the identified learning tactics and strategies, indicate a significant association between the strategies and performance and contribute to the employed method's generalisability by applying it to a new context. Implications This study provides an example of how learning analytics methods can be employed towards the development of effective learnersourcing systems and, more broadly, technological educational solutions that support learner-centred and data-driven learning at scale. Findings should inform best practices for integrating learnersourcing activities into course design and shed light on the relevance of tactics and strategies to support teachers in making informed pedagogical decisions.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys research and practice on enhancing peer assessment with artificial intelligence. Its objectives are to give the structure of the theoretical framework underpinning the study, synopsize a scoping review of the literature that illustrates this structure, and provide a case study which further illustrates this structure. The theoretical framework has six areas: (i) Assigning Peer Assessors, (ii) Enhancing Individual Reviews, (iii) Deriving Peer Grades/Feedback, (iv) Analyzing Student Feedback, (v) Facilitating Instructor Oversight and (vi) Peer Assessment Systems. The vast majority of the 79 papers in the review found that artificial intelligence improved peer assessment. However, the focus of many papers was on diversity in grades and feedback, fuzzy logic and the analysis of feedback with a view to equalizing its quality. Relatively few papers focused on automated assignment, automated assessment, calibration, teamwork effectiveness and automated feedback and these merit further research. This picture suggests AI is making inroads into peer assessment, but there is still a considerable way to go, particularly in the under-researched areas. The paper incorporates a case study of the RIPPLE peer-assessment tool, which harnesses student wisdom, insights from the learning sciences and AI to enable time-constrained educators to immerse their students in deep and personalized learning experiences that effectively prepare them to serve as assessors. Once trained, they use a comprehensive rubric to vet learning resources submitted by other students. They thereby create pools of high-quality learning resources which can be used to recommend personalized content to students. RIPPLE engages students in a trio of intertwined activities: creation, review and personalized practice, generating many resource types. AI-driven real-time feedback is given but students are counseled to assess whether it is accurate. Affordances and challenges for researchers and practitioners were identified.},

	abstract = {Engaging students in creating novel content, also referred to as learnersourcing, is increasingly recognised as an effective approach to promoting higher-order learning, deeply engaging students with course material and developing large repositories of content suitable for personalised learning. Despite these benefits, some common concerns and criticisms are associated with learnersourcing (e.g., the quality of resources created by students, challenges in incentivising engagement and lack of availability of reliable learnersourcing systems), which have limited its adoption. This paper presents a framework that considers the existing learnersourcing literature, the latest insights from the learning sciences and advances in AI to offer promising future directions for developing learnersourcing systems. The framework is designed around important questions and human-AI partnerships relating to four key aspects: (1) creating novel content, (2) evaluating the quality of the created content, (3) utilising learnersourced contributions of students and (4) enabling instructors to support students in the learnersourcing process. We then present two comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of the proposed framework in relation to two existing popular learnersourcing systems.},

Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can better equip individuals to critically engage with AI in their daily lives.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing and assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge competing conceptualizations of AI in practice and help shape the future of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. AI Thinking addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help to bridge between the work of diverse disciplines, contexts and actors in the AI space, and shape AI efforts in education, industrial development and policy.},

This article seeks to answer recent questions about growth mindset, such as: Does a growth mindset predict student outcomes? Do growth mindset interventions work, and work reliably? Are the effect sizes meaningful enough to merit attention? And can teachers successfully instill a growth mindset in students? After exploring the important lessons learned from these questions, the article concludes that large-scale studies, including pre-registered replications and studies conducted by third parties (such as international governmental agencies), justify confidence in growth mindset research. Mindset effects, however, are meaningfully heterogeneous across individuals and contexts. The article describes three recent advances that have helped the field to learn from this heterogeneity: standardized measures and interventions, studies designed specifically to identify where growth mindset interventions do not work (and why), and a conceptual framework for anticipating and interpreting moderation effects. The next generation of mindset research can build on these advances, for example, to begin to understand and perhaps change classroom contexts in ways that can make interventions more effective. Throughout, the authors reflect on lessons that can enrich meta-scientific perspectives on replication and generalization.},
